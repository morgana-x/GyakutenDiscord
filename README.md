# GyakutenDiscord
Low effort discord bot that sends commands over to an MGBA instance.

do /saiban to create a controller message, reccomended to do it in the VC Chat

or just type !saiban in a channel if you're not bothered to set the GUID

# Setup

Run MGBA and load any Gyakuten Saiban rom, and run the aceattorneybot.lua script (Tools>Scripting>Load Script)

Change the Token and GUID for the bot and server in the discord bot's source code (I'm really not putting much effort into this am I) and compile and run

Then stream the MGBA screen to discord VC
