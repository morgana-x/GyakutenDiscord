# GyakutenDiscord
Low effort discord bot that sends commands over to an MGBA instance / MelonDS.

do /saiban to create a controller message, reccomended to do it in the VC Chat

or just type !saiban in a channel if you're not bothered to set the server id

# Setup

Run MGBA and load any Gyakuten Saiban rom, and run the aceattorneybot.lua script (Tools>Scripting>Load Script)

Change the Token and server id for the bot and server in the discord bot's source code (I'm really not putting much effort into this am I) and compile and run

Then stream the MGBA screen to discord VC

Also works with melon ds and will detect it running in background, it uses a more dodgy input method

Keybinds will need to be set as per source code, unlike MGBA where inputs are sent over a socket connection
